<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>


This repository is used to publish and share templates and guidelines on capturing and using decision in agile software development. It is part of our research on decision management in agile software development. Unlike the approach of [joelparkerhenderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/), we do not only focus on [architectural decisions](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/#introduction) but on decisions being important to the development team. Thus, we consider every development related decision to be potentially important. Nevertheless, these are often architectural decisions.


According to the agile principle 'The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams' we assume that the team does know best what is an important decision and what is not (further elaboration can be found in the [decisions section](#decisions)). Nevertheless, we also encourage you to read [joelparkerhenderson's elaboration](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record/#introduction) on architectural decisions, if you are interested in the topic of managing decision. More literature on the topic of architectural knowledge management can be found [further down](#sources).

The goal of this document is to provide a fast overview of methods and templates of capturing decisions in agile software development, how to create them, and where to look for more information.


<h2><a name="decisions">What decision are we talking about?</a></h2>

As outlined above, we have no intention of telling someone what kind of decisions he/she should consider being particularly important. Thus, decisions to capture by the team can be of any type. In order to give potential users of our idea and our templates an idea of what decisions can be made, we have compiled a list of possible decision types below. This has been deduced on the basis of existing literature as well as student and industry studies we conducted. We think the list of decision types covers the majority of decisions that matter. Although there were still decisions in our studies which cannot be classified into the following types, the can be neglected based on their frequency. 

* Decisions regarding development tools – e.g., employed IDE, project management tools.
* Architectural decisions – e.g., interfaces definitions, architectural decisions. 
* Technology decisions – e.g., employed libraries and frameworks and its pros and cons.
* Decisions on the deployment plattform – e.g., deployment process, Android vs. iOS.
* Decisions on features – e.g., add / refine / change / remove a requirement.
* Decisions on priorising User Stories – e.g., postpone, prepone or omit a user story.
* Decisions on software quality measures – e.g., schedule a refactoring, a review or similar.
* Decisions regarding the user experience – e.g., revise the strategy for the user experience.
* Decisions regarding the team prganisation – e.g., changes of roles, staff reshuffling, or similar.
* Decisions on software development process – e.g., restructure the sprint based on the outcome of the retrospective

<h2><a name="decision-templates">Decision capture example templates</a></h2>

In the following listing you can find links to three templates for capturing decisions. We currently use them for experiments with students and industry practitioners. 

* [Simple template](templates/captureTemplate_simple.md) (Provides ...)
* [Extensive template](captureTemplate_full.md) (Provides ...)
* [Table-based template](captureTemplate_table.md) (Provides ...)
