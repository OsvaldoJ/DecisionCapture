# Our current approach of conducted meetings does not work. The communication within the team is insufficient. 
**UserStory:** *[TICKET/ISSUE-NUMBER]*

## Considered Alternatives:
* Maintain a regular daily scrum
* Conduct more group meetings to communicate and to do pair programming

## Conclusion
* *Chosen Alternative: Maintain a regular daily scrum.*
* *We need to maintain a regular daily scrum - this will solve the problem of lack of coordination in carrying out tasks that depend on each other, we will better meet deadlines and strengthen a common vision of the project (to resolve the disparities between certain team members).* (Optional)
