# Which IDE are we going to use?
**UserStory:** *[TICKET/ISSUE-NUMBER]*

## Considered Alternatives:
* IntelliJ
* Eclipse
* Netbeans

## Conclusion
* *Chosen Alternative: IntelliJ*
* **IDE IntelliJ - integrates many useful tools is very powerful, very good support for writing code and the number of procedures concerning the building project is done automatically. Unfortunately, the team had put considerable effort into adapting to this IDE, *Netbeans - considered as an alternative because of our experience of working in this environment with other tasks;  Unfortunately, it turned out to have poor support for chosen development framework, *Eclipse - considered because we already used in other development labs; however, it has been rejected due to lack of support for the chosen development framework.* (Optional)
