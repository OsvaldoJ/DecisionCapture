# How are we going to distribute the development tasks ahead of us?
**UserStory:** *[TICKET/ISSUE-NUMBER]*

## Considered Alternatives:
* Everybody is going to deal with every aspect of the application to come
* Clear division of labour. Every team member is responsible for one of the four major aspects of the application (database, documentation, feature implementation, test, user experience)

## Conclusion
* *Chosen Alternative: Clear division of labour.*
* *We considered that each of us will deal with every aspect of the application to some extent. However, this is not the best idea. It will consume much more time until completion compared to a strict division of labour.* (Optional)
